\title{Rank Samples Based on Type, Age, and Sequencing Status}
\usage{
rank_samples(
  metadata,
  sample_type_col = "SampleType",
  date_col = "CollectionDate",
  sequenced_col = "Sequenced",
  pop_col = "Pop",
  sample_type_ranking = NULL,
  prefer_recent = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{metadata}{A data frame containing sample metadata with spatial clusters.
Must contain a column for cluster IDs (specified by \code{pop_col}).}

\item{sample_type_col}{Character. Name of the column containing sample type information.
Sample types are ranked using the hierarchy defined in sample_type_ranking arg.
Default is "SampleType".}

\item{date_col}{Character. Name of the column containing collection dates.
Can handle multiple date formats (M/D/YYYY, M/D/YY, or standard R date formats).
Default is "CollectionDate".}

\item{sequenced_col}{Character. Name of the column indicating if a sample has been
sequenced. Should contain "Y" or "y" for sequenced samples. Default is "Sequenced".}

\item{pop_col}{Character. Name of the column containing cluster/population IDs.
Default is "Pop".}

\item{sample_type_ranking}{A data frame (optional) specifying the hierarchy of sample types.
Must contain two columns:
  SampleType: Character vector of sample types matching the metadata column.
  type_rank: Numeric rank where 1 = highest priority
If not provided, unsequenced samples will be ranked by age only.}

\item{prefer_recent}{Logical. If TRUE, more recent samples are ranked higher.
If FALSE, older samples are ranked higher. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the same structure as input, with additional columns:
  \describe{
    \item{type_rank}{Numeric rank based on sample type (1 = highest quality)}
    \item{age_years}{Age of sample in years from collection date}
    \item{age_rank}{Rank based on sample age}
    \item{is_sequenced}{Logical indicating if sample has been sequenced}
    \item{composite_rank}{Combined rank based on sequencing status, type, and age}
    \item{cluster_rank}{Final rank within each cluster (1 = highest priority)}
  }
}
\description{
Ranks samples within each spatial cluster based on sample quality (type),
age, and whether they have already been sequenced. Already-sequenced samples
receive the highest priority, followed by samples ranked by quality and age.
}
\details{
The ranking hierarchy prioritizes samples as follows:
\enumerate{
  \item Already sequenced samples (always ranked highest & always selected)...
  \item Sample type e.g. Blood > Feather > Tissue > Toe pad (Bird example)
  \item Sample age (recent or old, depending on \code{prefer_recent})
}
}
